# file_transfers

This Shell script is an example of how to set up a batch transfer via the Globus CLI. Users must have access to both the source and destination endpoints, and be authenticated within the Globus CLI. See their [documentation](https://docs.globus.org/cli/) for more information on installing and setting up the CLI tool.

Please reference the Globus documentation on [batch transfers](https://docs.globus.org/cli/examples/#batch_transfers) for information on how the referenced file list text file should be formatted.
