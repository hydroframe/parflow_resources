# parflow_resources
This repo contains scripts, helper functions, and assorted tools that were used when running a ParFlow model on the entire CONUS2 domain. Some of these scripts have been adapted to use a computing cluster, such as Princeton's Tiger3 cluster, while others are more general. Our goal is to provide these as resources that may be adapted for other large-scale ParFlow runs.

Please feel free to contribute your own scripts/workflows that faciliate doing research with ParFlow.
